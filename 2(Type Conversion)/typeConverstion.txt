- Converting one data type to another data type is called type conversion.
1.String to Number
2.Number to String
3. straight boolean. When do we expect value as false and true.
4. boolean to String
5. boolean to number: To convert boolean to integer, let us first declare 
a variable of boolean primitive. boolean bool = true; Now, to convert it
 to integer, let us now take an integer variable and return a value “1” 
 for “true” and “0” for “false”. int val = (bool) 
  function fnConvertBooleanToNumber() { 
	  var convertedBoolValue = IsLoggedIn ? 1 : 0; 
	  alert(convertedBoolValue); 
 }

- We must understand there is only one type of number. Numbers can be written with or without
decimals.


****Imp
JavaScript uses the + operator for both addition and concatenation.

Numbers are added. Strings are concatenated.
