1. What is the difference between document and window objects in Js?
: 
The Window interface represents a window containing a DOM document; 
the document property points to the DOM document loaded in that window.
Basically window is the parent in hierarchy. 

When you just type "window" you will see document object nested
inside the window object. 

Now document object model creates the DOM hirearchy.

2. So why are we talking about difference between document and window object models?
: Because when we are working on some methods of javascript like alert. We should know alert lies in 
window not in document. So doing document.alert is wrong. And window.alert is right way.


----let's see some of the popular methods in window and document----------
Method	Description
open()	Opens a new browser window
print()	Prints the content of the current window
prompt()	Displays a dialog box that prompts the visitor for input

===Iframe====
If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML 
document, and one additional window object for each frame.
